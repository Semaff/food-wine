                <p>
                    With a well-travelled background and a passion for locally grown produce, Andrew Saxon has been
                    appointed Head Chef at
                    Food and Wine Restaurant not so long ago. Andrew returned to our restaurant after spending the
                    previous
                    17 years
                    abroad working as Head Chef in a number of iconic restaurants in London and Australia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In his early years as an emerging chef, Andrew spent time at Vinnies Restaurant under the guidance
                    of
                    David Griffiths
                    before taking over as Head Chef at the acclaimed ‘Paramount’. Andrew then decided to cross the
                    Tasman to
                    explore the gastronomic
                    scene stepping into the Head Chef role at the well-regarded Justin Winery. Not ready to stop there,
                    Andrew then took his
                    culinary skills to London where he continued to expand his repertoire. It was Andrew’s return to our
                    country that offered a highly rewarding
                    venture in his career, opening Firmino Restaurant in our city, with its further introduction
                    in other states. Andrew, together with his wife Alice, owned and operated the restaurant for 5 years
                    picking up a number of accolades and reviews.
