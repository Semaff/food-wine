                        Wines in France - really in almost all of Europe - had developed their styles
                        over the centuries; a grape (more often a blend of grapes) was eventually found
                        to suit an area - or even better, express the area. To know where the grapes are
                        grown is to know the style of the wine. To know much about the grapes themselves
                        was wine geekdom, only necessary for professionals.
