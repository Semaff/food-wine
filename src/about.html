                From the moment you enter the beautiful granite and timber building that houses the Food & Wine
                Restaurant
                and Cellar Door, you know you have found something very, very special. The staff greet you
                warmly and the menu and wines on offer tempt you into whiling away an afternoon sitting on
                the long verandah or under the peppermint trees, watching the wines breathe and whisper around you.

                <h3 class="history__title">Downtown New York, 1946</h3>

                <p class="history__text">
                    Food & Wine Restaurant opened in November of 1999. The owners, Bob Stewart and Tom
                    Pazianos had spent many years in the restaurant business as franchisees and they were
                    ready to open an original concept. They had slowly developed a plan over many years
                    of visiting restaurants all over North America and the world. Ideas they had collected
                    and designs they had studied were worked out and refined here.
                </p>

                <p class="history__text">
                    The name "Food & Wine Restaurant" was suggested by cofounders of the establishment.
                    They felt the name could make it clear for visitors what they will get at the
                    restaurant. More importantly, they believed it would give the flexibility to develop
                    diverse menu selections. The name would not leave people with preconceived notions
                    of the style and types of food or the atmosphere they'd find inside.
                    From that point, we could present Italian, Asian, or any other cuisine.

                    Here, the surroundings are comfortable and the focus is contemporary cuisine of
                    exceptional quality. Signature dishes created by our chef include certified Angus
                    tenderloin, cedar plank salmon, black and blue ahi tuna and wood oven pizzas.
                    Our desserts are prepared in-house by our pastry chef. Our extensive wine list
                    was compiled by our wine expert with numerous vintage wines as well as over 30 wines
                    by the glass.

                <p class="history__text">
                    Food & Wine Restaurant has been listed in "Where to Eat in the US" for several years
                    running and the wine list has earned the "Wine Spectator Award of Excellence" every
                    year since 2002. It became possible due to our loyal visitors and clients that admire
                    our wines and dishes since 1999.
